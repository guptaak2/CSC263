\subsection*{Graphs}

\noindent A graph $G=(V,E)$ consists of a set of ``vertices'' (or ``nodes'') $V$ and
a set of ``edges'' (or ``arcs'') $E$. \\

\noindent In a \textbf{directed} graph, each edge is a pair of two vertices $(u,v)$ is considered
different from the pair $(v,u)$, self-loops of the form $(u,u)$ are allowed. \\

\noindent In an \textbf{undirected} graph each set of two vertices $\{u,v\}$ (so $\{u,v\}$ and
$\{v,u\}$ are the same) and self loops are disallowed. \\

\noindent A \textbf{weighted} graph is either directed or undirected. Each edge $e \in E$ is assigned
a real number $w(e)$ called its weight. \\

\noindent \textit{A story to solve with a graph:} \\
There is a party. 4 couples attend the party. Hand shaking occurs at the party.
Hand shaking is reciprocal. Nobody shakes hands with their date. No duplicate answers
when a person $P$ asks everyone else how many hands did they shake. How many hands did $P$ shake? \\

\subsubsection*{Standard operations on graphs}

\begin{itemize}
	\item add a vertex; remove a vertex; add an edge; remove and edge
	\item edge query
		\begin{itemize}
			\item given two vertices $u,v$ find out if a directed edge $(u,v)$ or
				undirected edge $\{u,v\}$ is in the graph
		\end{itemize}
	\item neighbourhood
		\begin{itemize}
			\item given a vertex $u$ in an undirected graph, find the set of vertices $v$
				such that $\{u,v\}$ is an edge
		\end{itemize}
	\item in-neighbourhood, out-neighbourhood
		\begin{itemize}
			\item apply to directed graph
			\item in-neighbourhood $\rightarrow$ given a vertex $u$ in a directed graph, set of
				vertices $v$ such that $(v,u) \in G$
			\item out-neighbourhood $\rightarrow$ given a vertex $u$ in a directed graph, set of
				vertices $v$ such that $(u,v) \in G$
		\end{itemize}
	\item degree, in-degree, out-degree
		\begin{itemize}
			\item degree $\rightarrow$ size of neighbourhood
		\end{itemize}
	\item traversal
		\begin{itemize}
			\item visit each vertex of the graph to perform some task
		\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Definitions}

\noindent \textbf{path}:= a set of edges to get from one vertex to another: $(v,u_1),(u_1,u_2),\ldots,(u_{k-1},w)$ \\
\textbf{length of path}:= number of edges\\
\textbf{simple path}:= no repeated edge or vertex \\
\textbf{cycle}:= a path with the end vertex equal to start vertex\\
\textbf{simple cycle}:= a cycle with no repeated edge or vertex \\
\textbf{tree}:= undirected graph that is acylic and connected \\
\textbf{forest}:= acyclic graph (collection of disjoint trees, each one a ``connected component'')\\

\subsubsection*{Adjacency Matrix}

\noindent Let $V = {v_1,v_2,\ldots,v_n}$. Store edges in $[n \cdot n]$ array: \\

\begin{tabular}{l | l l l l l l l}
	& A & B & C & D & E & F & G \\ \hline
  A & 0 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
  B & 1 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
  C & 1 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\
  D & 1 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 1 \\
  E & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
  F & 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
  G & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
\end{tabular} \\

\noindent Undirected graphs: matrix is symmetric ($A[i,j] = A[j.i]$) \\
Space $\in Theta(n^2)$, edge queries take time $\Theta(1)$. \\
Weighted graph: store $w(v_i,v_j)$ in $A[i,j]$ if $(v_i,v_j)$ in $E$; special value (-1/0/$\infty$) otherwise (depending on application)

\subsubsection*{Adjacency List}

Let V = ${v_1,v_2,\ldots,v_n}$. Store edges in a list of lists: ``main'' list has positions $1,\ldots,n$ (one for each vertex); \\
sub-list[$i$] contains $j_1,\ldots,j_{k_i}$ such that $(v_i,v_{j_1}), \ldots, (v_i,v_{i_{k_i}})$ are all edges from $v_i$. \\
Undirected graph: edge $\{u,v\}$ stored twice ($u$ in sub-list[$v$] and $v$ in
sub-list[$u$]). \\

\begin{tabular}{l | l}
	A & b,c \\
	B & \\
	C & a,b,c \\
	D & e \\
	E & \\
\end{tabular} \\

\noindent Space $\in \Theta(n+m)$ (where $n = |V|$ and $m = |E|$). \\
Edge queries in time $\Theta(\log n)$ (actually, $\Theta(\log (\textrm{max degree} )))$ if sub-lists stored in balanced trees.
